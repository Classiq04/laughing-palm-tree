# 🚀 Helm Base Template — For Smart, Lazy, Hungry DevOps Engineers 😤

Welcome to the **only Helm chart you'll ever need to start ANY project** fast. This is not your typical copy-paste mess. 
This is a **clean, reusable, no-bloat, no-nonsense Helm chart** for deploying containerized applications like a boss.

## 🔥 Why This Exists

Because `helm create` gives you a migraine.

I was tired of deleting 50 lines of comments, confusing conditionals, and YAML spaghetti every time I needed to ship something quick. So I built this instead — and now it's yours too.

## 📦 What’s Inside

- ✅ Clean **Deployment** + **Service** template
- ✅ Minimal, editable **`values.yaml`**
- ✅ Easy plug-and-play **Ingress**
- ✅ Built-in **ConfigMap** and **Secret** support
- ✅ No fluff. No headache. Just deploy and go.

## 🛠️ How to Use It?????????? Just Clone It or Copy It
